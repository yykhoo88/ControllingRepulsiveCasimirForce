## Description
This git is basically a collection of my Matlab codes used to generate materials needed for my paper published in Physical Review A.
These files are not arranged accordingly and poorly commented as they are wrote singularly for generating graphs, and back then I do not have "good coding ettiques".
These files are separated by folders.

## Folder "Casimir Force"
The main files that make up the paper. Files are separated into folders for different scenario, i.e. for different materials like a perfect conductor or As2S3. Also introduced is the Optical Kerr Effect, which are given by "Kerr Varied" folders. Yang et al. models are also being explored.

## Folder "EIT"
EIT is short form for Electromagnectically induced transperancy. This folder contains all the model required to analytically model a material that may be EIT-ed, using the Yang et al. transient model.

## Folder "H-atom"
The hydrogen atom modelling files distributed by MathWorks (Copyright (c) 2009, The MathWorks). This folder is called on several files to generate models of spherical Casimir Effect.
